Recommendation systems, or recommender systems, are systems that make suggestions related to search history or ratings of n products by a group of m users, in order to provide personalized recommendations to individual users. In short, while search engines help users find what they want, recommendation systems help users find more of what they like or relevant alternatives. search and decision-making processes are crucial for such systems. Quantum computing has the potential to demonstrate that for some problems quantum computation is more efficient than classical computation. Based on that, we are preparing an educational content about the quantum walk model and its application on various types of problems especially in search algorithm and decision-making, and then we try to do a simple qiskit implementation of the model on 1D and 2D graphs for developing an efficient quantum model for such systems on future.
