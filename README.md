Recommendation systems, or recommender systems, are systems that make suggestions related to search history or ratings of n products by a group of m users, in order to provide personalized recommendations to individual users. In short, while search engines help users find what they want, recommendation systems help users find more of what they like or relevant alternatives. search and decision-making processes are crucial for such systems. Quantum computing has the potential to demonstrate that for some problems quantum computation is more efficient than classical computation. Based on that, we are preparing an educational content about the quantum walk model and its application on various types of problems especially in search algorithm and decision-making, and then we try to do a simple qiskit implementation of the model on 1D and 2D graphs for developing an efficient quantum model for such systems on future.

A random walk, known as a stochastic or random process, is a mathematical tool that describes a path consisting of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.

Random walks have applications to engineering and many scientific fields including ecology, psychology, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, economics and sociology. It explains the observed behaviors of many processes in the above-mentioned fields and thus serves as a fundamental model for the recorded stochastic activity.
For example, the path taken by a molecule when moving in gas or liquid, the path taken by a herbivore, stock price fluctuations, and the financial condition of a gambler; These are items that can be modelled by lagging.

The term random walk was first introduced by Karl Pearson in 1905.

In this project, we had an overview of classical and quantum random walks, explained their differences, and then looked more closely at quantum random walks and their types, including continuous-time and discrete-time.

Since our goal was to investigate quantum random walk application on decision-making and graph networks, as well as considering the wide applications of discrete-time random walk in these processes, we study this group of quantum random walk and its types, particularly, coin model.

We developed theoretical relationships related to the â€Œcoin model and tried to implement this model in a 1D graph network on the Qiskit platform.
